# QuickSort-with-OpenMP

Parallelizing QuickSort using OpenMP

The quicksort algorithm sorts the list of numbers by first dividing the list into two sublists, so that all the numbers in one sublist are smaller than all the numbers in the second sublist. This is done by selecting one number, the pivot, against which all other numbers are compared to. The numbers which are less than the pivot are placed in one sublist, the numbers which greater compared to the pivot, are placed in the other sublist. The pivot can be either placed in one sublist or could be withheld and placed in its final position.
